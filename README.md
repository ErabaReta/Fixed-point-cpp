# Fixed-point-cpp
implementing Fixed point class to replace floating points in c++
## THE IDEA
As we all know (or most of us) floating point was  a smart invention but it unfortunatly the add a computing overhead. well, yeah they sucks, so I m trying today to make a simple design for a Fixed point where we prefer computing speed over precetion, accurracy, range, whoah thats many things. but yeah we get more perfermonce , yay. (i ll put later why floating points are bad, and why we call them floats, and why  fixed called fixed, or may be you do a pull request and do it ?).
